This project explores Toronto's TTC subway delay data to understand operational inefficiencies, safety risks, and equity concerns across the system. Our key research questions are organized into four categories:
I. System-Wide Trends

    Has the number of minutes in delay increased over the years?

    Which types of delays cause the most total disruption?

    What are the most common causes of delays — and have they changed over time?

II. Root Cause & Infrastructure Analysis

    Signal issues — Are particular vehicles or train models consistently affected?

    Security incidents (by station) — Are some stations seeing a rise over the years? (→ Supports platform door recommendations)

    Security incidents (by time) — Are there time patterns (e.g., late-night spikes)?

III. Spatial & Temporal Patterns

    Which stations experience the most frequent or severe delays?

    Which subway lines are most delay-prone?

    When do delays occur most often — during peak or off-peak hours?

    Which months have the most delays (e.g., winter-related issues)?

    Are delays clustered around major city events?

IV. Equity & Impact

    Do delays disproportionately affect neighborhoods with fewer transit alternatives?
