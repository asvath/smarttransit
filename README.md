This project explores Toronto's TTC subway delay data to understand operational inefficiencies, safety risks, and equity concerns across the system. Our key research questions are organized into four categories:

I. System-Wide Trends

    Has the number of minutes in delay increased over the years?

    Which types of delays cause the most total disruption?

    What are the most common causes of delays  and have they changed over time?

II. Root Cause & Infrastructure Analysis

    Signal issues: Are particular vehicles or train models consistently affected?

    Security incidents (by station): Are some stations seeing a rise over the years? (→ Supports platform door recommendations)

    Security incidents (by time): Are there time patterns (e.g., late-night spikes)?

III. Spatial & Temporal Patterns

    Which stations experience the most frequent or severe delays?

    Which subway lines are most delay-prone?

    When do delays occur most often: during peak or off-peak hours?

    Which months have the most delays (e.g., winter-related issues)?

### Reference Files

**ttc_subway_stations_with_linecodes.txt** (in `data/raw/docs/`)  
Manually created list of all valid operational subway stations with their line codes. Used in the preprocessing pipeline
to standardize and validate station names, and categorize stations as passenger, non-passenger, or unknown.

**ttc_subway_geodata.json** (in `data/raw/docs/`)  
Contains all valid operational subway stations with their latitude/longitude coordinates.
Generated by `pipelines/build_station_geodata.py`, which extracts geodata from OpenStreetMap (OSM).
Some stations are added manually when not available in OSM.

## Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

### Raw Data Overview

The raw TTC dataset consists of:
- Excel files containing subway delay event data (2018 – June 2025)
- Delay code files mapping codes to event descriptions
  - `Code Descriptions.csv` - Primary file used (contains more comprehensive codes)
  - `ttc-subway-delay-codes.xlsx` - Not used (contains SRT codes which are excluded from this analysis)
- TTC-provided README file with column names and descriptions

### Preprocessing Pipeline

The preprocessing pipeline (`pipelines/preprocess_pipeline.py`) performs the following steps:

#### 1. Clean Delay Codes & Descriptions
- Process `Code Descriptions.csv` (TTC-provided file with comprehensive delay codes)
- Remove non-ASCII characters from delay code descriptions
- Output a cleaned mapping for consistent downstream use
- Output: `data/raw/code_descriptions/Clean Code Descriptions.csv`
- Note: `ttc-subway-delay-codes.xlsx` is not used as it contains SRT codes excluded from this analysis

#### 2. Merge & Clean Raw Delay Data
- Merge all raw TTC delay files into a single dataframe
- Log file names used for the merge and any errors
- Drop rows where:
  - Any key column (Min delay, Min Gap, Vehicle) is missing or zero
  - Min Gap < Min delay (gap between trains should exceed the delay)
  - Duplicate rows exist
- Write dropped data to `data/raw/dropped_raw/`

#### 3. Standardize Station Names
- Remove embedded line codes (e.g., "YU", "BD") from station names
- Standardize abbreviations (e.g., "St" → "St.")
- Correct spelling errors
- Ensure all passenger station names end with "STATION" (unless they end with YARD, HOSTLER, WYE, POCKET, TAIL, or TRACK, which are legitimate non-passenger station endings)
- Standardize naming for dual-line interchange stations (e.g., "BLOOR-YONGE", "SHEPPARD-YONGE")

#### 4. Station Categorization
Tag stations as:
- **passenger** - Listed in the valid operational stations file
- **non-passenger** - Ending with yard/hostler/etc.
- **unknown** - Cannot be matched (e.g., SRT, severe typos, directional suffixes)

Drop all unknown and non-passenger stations from analysis and write them to `data/raw/dropped_raw/`

#### 5. Validate Delay Codes
- Ensure all delay codes match the cleaned delay code mapping
- Set invalid codes to NaN (spelling errors where correct code is unknown)

#### 6. Validate Bound (Direction)
- For valid passenger stations, verify the direction (Bound) matches the station's subway line
- Example: ROSEDALE STATION (YU line) with "E" direction is invalid (YU only has N/S)
- Set invalid directions to NaN

#### 7. Clean & Standardize Date/Time
- Standardize all date and time columns as strings
- Combine into a new DateTime column as pandas datetime objects
- Enables hour, weekday, and time-based analysis

#### 8. Correct Day of Week
- Recompute Day field using the DateTime column to ensure accuracy

#### 9. Add Derived Features
- **IsWeekday** - Boolean (True/False)
- **Rush Hour** - Categorical ("Morning", "Evening", "Off Peak: Afternoon", "Off Peak: Night", "Weekend")
- **Season** - Categorical ("Winter", "Spring", "Summer", "Fall")
- **Delay Category** - Categorical ("Patron", "Mechanical/Infrastructure", etc.)
- **Delay Description** - Human-readable description based on delay code

#### 10. Final Validation & Output
- Drop any remaining invalid rows after cleaning
- Log all cleaned stations by category for manual review
- Write final cleaned dataset to `data/processed/delays/YYYY-MM-DD/cleaned_delay_data_YYYY-MM-DD-HH_MM_SS.csv`

### How to Run

Ensure your working directory is set to the project root (`SmartTransit/`).

Run the preprocessing pipeline:
```bash
python pipelines/preprocess_pipeline.py
```

**Output files:**
- `data/processed/delays/YYYY-MM-DD/cleaned_delay_data_YYYY-MM-DD-HH_MM_SS.csv`
- `data/raw/code_descriptions/Clean Code Descriptions.csv` (requires further manual processing)
- 
## Delay Code Classification

### Purpose

The TTC maintains detailed subway delay codes that describe specific causes of service disruptions. 
While these codes are highly precise, they use technical jargon that can be difficult to interpret.

By grouping individual codes into broader, standardized categories, we can:

- **Identify trends** - Track which types of issues (e.g., Mechanical/Infrastructure, Patron, Weather) cause the most delays over time
- **Simplify communication** - Replace technical jargon with clear, high-level categories easier for the public and media to understand
- **Enable reusability** - Allow researchers, journalists, and advocates to use this work without deciphering the TTC's internal code system

This classification system transforms operational delay data into an actionable tool for both internal analysis and public communication.

---

### Classification System

We manually classified all delay codes in `data/raw/code_descriptions/Clean Code Descriptions.csv` into the following categories:

- **Mechanical/Vehicle** - Faults or issues with the train itself (propulsion, brakes, HVAC, doors, onboard electronics, etc.)
- **Mechanical/Infrastructure** - Failures of transit infrastructure (track, signals, power systems, etc.)
- **Patron** - Incidents caused by customers (medical emergencies, disorderly conduct, trespassing, vandalism, alarm activation, etc.)
- **Weather** - Delays due to natural events (snow, ice, etc.)
- **Operational/Process** - Staff/operator errors, procedural mistakes, operational decisions, maintenance errors
- **Planned Work** - Scheduled closures and construction
- **Unplanned Work** - Closures due to unplanned work
- **Other/Internal** - Labour disputes, assault involving staff, fire inside TTC property, etc.
- **Other/External** - Delays caused by outside parties or events beyond TTC's direct control (external power failure, contractor issues, etc.)
- **Other/Unknown** - Cause cannot be determined due to insufficient detail

---

### Output File

**TTC_Delay_Codes_Categories_and_Reasoning.csv** (in `data/processed/code_descriptions/`)

This file contains the complete classification with the following fields:

- **Code** - The TTC delay code identifier
- **Code Description** - The official description from TTC logs
- **Category** - Assigned classification
- **Reasoning** - Technical explanation of why the code fits that category
- **Public Explanation** - Plain-language explanation of the delay suitable for public communication

**Example:** The code "EUCO: Couplers" is classified as **Mechanical/Vehicle**, with the technical reasoning: *"Connectors that join train cars and allow electrical systems to pass between them,"* and the public explanation: *"Connectors between train cars not working properly."*
