This project explores Toronto's TTC subway delay data to understand operational inefficiencies, safety risks, and equity concerns across the system. Our key research questions are organized into four categories:

I. System-Wide Trends

    Has the number of minutes in delay increased over the years?

    Which types of delays cause the most total disruption?

    What are the most common causes of delays — and have they changed over time?

II. Root Cause & Infrastructure Analysis

    Signal issues — Are particular vehicles or train models consistently affected?

    Security incidents (by station) — Are some stations seeing a rise over the years? (→ Supports platform door recommendations)

    Security incidents (by time) — Are there time patterns (e.g., late-night spikes)?

III. Spatial & Temporal Patterns

    Which stations experience the most frequent or severe delays?

    Which subway lines are most delay-prone?

    When do delays occur most often — during peak or off-peak hours?

    Which months have the most delays (e.g., winter-related issues)?

    Are delays clustered around major city events?

IV. Equity & Impact

    Do delays disproportionately affect neighborhoods with fewer transit alternatives?


## Delay Code Classification Logic

We manually categorized TTC subway delay codes using the following logic:

- **Mechanical:** Failures of transit infrastructure or equipment (track, signals, motors, brakes, etc.)
- **Human/Process:** Staff/operator mistakes or maintenance errors
- **Weather:** Delays due to natural events (snow, ice, flood, heat, etc.)
- **Patron:** Incidents caused by customers or the public (medical, disorderly, trespassing, vandalism, etc.)
- **Other/External:** Labor disputes, security, systemwide outages, power failures (external), or any ambiguous causes
