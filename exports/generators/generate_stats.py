"""
Generates the following stats and saves them in JSON file:
    Generates the following station stats for a given year:
    - total delays
    - time lost measured in days
    - number of major delays (> 20min)
    - % of system-wide delays originating here
    - top reason for delay by count
    - time lost due to top delay by count
    - top reason for delay by time lost
    - time lost due to top delay by time
    
    Generates the following station stats for the lastest year for the leaderboard:
    - total delays
    - time lost measured in days
    - number of major delays (> 20min)
    - % of system-wide delays originating here
    - top reason for delay by count
    - time lost due to top delay by count
    - top reason for delay by time lost
    - time lost due to top delay by time
    
    Generates delay code specific stats for a given range of years:
    - stations that are consistently in top N for a given delay code across the years: 
        - Avg Delay per Incident
        - Avg Count per Year
        - Avg Time Lost per Year
    
    Generates line specific stats:
    -For each line we get stats per bound per time window (e.g Line: YU, Bound: N, Rush Hour: Evening):
        - total number of delays
        - total delay min
        - avg delay min
        - number of days (weekday or weekend)
        - expected no. of delays
        - probability of having at least 1 delay
        - 90th-percentile delay count: smallest k with P(X ≤ k) ≥ 0.90
        - recommended buffer to add to travel time
